for rooms n1.....nx (where x is number of rooms)

A, len = 3
B, len = 4
C, len = 5

Number of ants = 24

add lengths of rooms together and divide by number of paths
3 + 4 + 5 = 12 / 3 = 4

For each path, calculate the difference between it's length and the average length

for A: -1
for B: 0
for C: +1

... and add it to the number of ants each room would normally get:
Normal amount of ants: 24 / 3 = 8
So A gets 8 - -1 = 9 ants
B gets 8 - 0 = 8 ants
C gets 8 - 1 = 7 ants

For our previous example:
Len B = 4
Len C = 8
nants = 20

4 + 8 = 12 / 2 rooms = 6 average length of paths

diff B: -2
diff C: +2

amount of ants on average: 20 / 2 = 10
B gets 10 - -2 = 12 ants
C gets 10 - 2 = 8 ants
